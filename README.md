# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

A modern implementation of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills through an engaging and interactive game experience.

## 🎮 Game Description

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic variant of the classic game where you play on a 3x3 grid of smaller tic-tac-toe boards. Your move determines which board your opponent must play on next, adding layers of strategy and complexity to the traditional game.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- (Optional) VS Code with Live Server extension
- (Optional) Python 3.x or Node.js for local server

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/papitalos/hashgame-two.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```bash
   cd hashgame-two
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   Choose one of the following methods:

#### Method 1: Direct Browser Access (Simplest)
- Double-click on `index.html` in your file explorer
- Or drag and drop `index.html` into your browser

#### Method 2: VS Code Live Server (Recommended for Development)
1. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
4. The game will open automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`


## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click on any of the 9 mini-boards to begin
2. **Make Your Move**: Click on a cell within the selected mini-board
